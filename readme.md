### Hello there ✌️

### I'm a designer and developer from Germany, focused on crafting unified and clear design languages for rich, beautiful products.

Media designer at neuwaerts, co-founder of XVI CHAPEL, marketing manager at World of Bass and freelance designer – In the past decade I had the delight to experience many facettes of the design industry.

Today, I'm working at [neuwaerts](https://www.neuwaerts.de/), helping clients design, develop and launch their products.
