# Hello there ✌️

### I am a designer and developer from Germany. Focused on creating consistent and clear design languages for rich, beautiful products.

Full Stack Developer at neuwaerts, Co-Founder of XVI CHAPEL, Marketing Manager at World of Bass and Freelance Designer & Developer - over the past decade I have had the delight of experiencing many facets of the design industry.

Today I'm working at neuwaerts, helping clients to design, develop and launch their products. In my spare time I contribute to aggregata.de and freelance for selected clients.
