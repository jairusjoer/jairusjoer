### I am a developer and designer from Germany. Focused on creating consistent and clear design languages for rich, beautiful products.

Full Stack Developer at neuwaerts, Co-Founder of XVI CHAPEL, Marketing Manager at World of Bass and Freelance Designer & Developer - over the past decade I have had the delight of experiencing many facets of the design industry.
